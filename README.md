# Cloud-Native Two-Tier Application on Amazon EKS

## Project Overview

This repository contains a cloud-native two-tier web application designed to demonstrate containerization, Kubernetes application deployment, and CI/CD automation on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS).

The project consists of a static frontend and a Python-based backend API, both containerized using Docker and deployed to Kubernetes using Helm charts. A Jenkins pipeline automates the application build and deployment process, while the AWS Load Balancer Controller provisions an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to expose the application externally.

In addition to application deployment, the repository includes supporting components such as the Metrics Server for Kubernetes resource monitoring and k6 scripts for basic load testing.

The AWS infrastructure required to host this application—including the VPC, Amazon EKS cluster, IAM resources, networking components, and Terraform remote backend—is maintained in a separate infrastructure repository.
